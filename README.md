This project aims to create a temperature control system using a DHT22 sensor, a Raspberry Pi, and an ESP8266 microcontroller. The system will monitor the temperature and humidity data from the sensor and use that data to control a relay connected to the ESP8266, enabling or disabling it based on the temperature. The ESP8266 will also check for a heartbeat from the Raspberry Pi to ensure that the system is still connected and functioning properly.
